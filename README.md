<h1 align="center">👋 I'm CTCycle, welcome to my GitHub! 👋 </h1>

Hi, I’m Thomas (also known as CTCycle). I’m an Italian data science enthusiast with more than 10 years of experience, currently working as a Senior Data Scientist and ML Engineer at Inmatica S.p.A. My journey started in biotechnology. I earned a bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology from the University of Genoa, followed by a master’s in Advanced Biotechnologies and a PhD in Engineering Sciences at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. During my PhD, I worked on the CheckPack project, developing micro-sensors to detect food spoilage and monitor quality. That project gave me hands-on experience in research and taught me how rewarding it can be to collaborate with both academic and industrial partners. During this time, I discovered how much I enjoy data analysis and machine learning. Since then, I’ve focused on exploring different types of datasets, from core STEM areas to complex biological domains. What excites me most is building tools that can improve healthcare, support drug discovery, and turn raw data into meaningful insights.

I’m looking forward to connecting with this community, sharing my work, and learning from others who share the same curiosity and drive for innovation.

Happy coding to all!
