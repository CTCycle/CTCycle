<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ I'm CTCycle, welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

I'm Thomas (aka CTCycle), an Italian data science enthusiast with over 10 years of experience, currently working as a Senior Data Scientist and ML Engineer at InMatica S.p.A. My journey began with a deep interest in biotechnology, which inspired me to earn a bachelor's degree in Biotechnology from the University of Genoa. Driven by the desire to expand my knowledge, I pursued a master's degree in Advanced Biotechnologies at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), and ultimately completed a PhD in Engineering Sciences at VUBâ€™s Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry Department (CHIS). During my doctoral studies, I contributed to the CheckPack project (https://pack4food.be/en/projects/checkpack), where I developed micro-sensors for detecting food spoilage and monitoring quality, gaining valuable experience in independent research and cross-disciplinary collaboration with both academic institutions and industrial partners.

It was during this period that I discovered my passion for data analysis and machine learningâ€”a realization that has shaped my professional path ever since. I thrive on exploring diverse scientific datasets, whether from core STEM fields or complex biological domains, and enjoy building tools that advance healthcare, enhance drug discovery, and transform raw data into actionable insights. Iâ€™m eager to engage with this incredible community, share my work, and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts who are equally driven by curiosity and innovation.

Happy coding to everyone!
