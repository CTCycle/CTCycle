<h1 align="center">👋 I'm CTCycle, welcome to my GitHub! 👋 </h1>

I'm Thomas (aka CTCycle), an italian data science enthusiast with over 10 years of experience. My journey began with a passion for biotechnology, which led me to pursue a bachelor's degree in Biotechnology at the University of Genoa. Seeking further advancement, I completed a master's degree in Advanced Biotechnologies at the Vrije Universiteit of Brussel (VUB), where my academic career culminated in a PhD in Chemical Engineering at the Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry Department at VUB. As part of the CheckPack project (https://pack4food.be/en/projects/checkpack), I developed micro-sensors for food spoilage detection and quality monitoring, honing my skills in independent research and collaboration with academic and industrial partners.

During this time, I discovered my passion for data analysis and machine learning, which has driven my career ever since. I love diving into data to optimize chemical processes, advance renewable energy, and innovate in healthcare and drug design, turning complex data into actionable insights. However, despite all the experience I may have in data science, my adventure on GitHub is just starting. I am excited to immerse myself in this dynamic platform, share my projects, and collaborate with like-minded professionals. I look forward to contributing valuable insights and innovations, learning from others, and growing together within this exceptional network.

Happy coding to everyone!
