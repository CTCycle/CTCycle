<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ I'm CTCycle, welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

I'm Thomas (aka CTCycle), an italian data science enthusiast with over 10 years of experience, currently working as Senior Data Scientist and ML Engineer at InMatica S.p.A. My journey began with a passion for biotechnology, which led me to pursue a bachelor's degree in Biotechnology at the University of Genoa. Seeking further advancement, I completed a master's degree in Advanced Biotechnologies at the Vrije Universiteit of Brussel (VUB), culminating my academic career with a PhD in Engineering Sciences at the Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry Department (CHIS) at VUB. As part of the CheckPack project (https://pack4food.be/en/projects/checkpack), I developed micro-sensors for food spoilage detection and quality monitoring, honing my skills in independent research and collaboration with academic and industrial partners.

During this time, I discovered my passion for data analysis and machine learning, which has driven my career ever since. I thrive on diving into scientific data of all kinds, from core STEM subjects to complex biological topics, developing tools that advance healthcare and drug design, and transforming intricate datasets into actionable insights. Iâ€™m excited to immerse myself in this incredible community, share my projects, and collaborate with like-minded professionals. 

Happy coding to everyone!
